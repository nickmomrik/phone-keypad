Reading from a keyboard taken out of an old phone, dated 1980!

Due to wiring up both the columns and rows to be digital on/off intead of sending pulses through the columns and then reading rows, I couldn't use the [Arduino Keypad library](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Keypad).

Read about my journey of tinkering with this keypad over on my blog, Phone Keypad Hacking: [Part 1](https://nick.blog/2017/04/29/phone-keypad-hacking-part-1/) and Part 2 coming soon.

This is a screenshot of the Fritzing wiring...

...and then the final product when I wired and soldered everything up to a perma-proto board...
